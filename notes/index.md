# OSI Layers
The task of network transfer is divided into seven independent tasks assigned to a layer as follows.

4 of these layers are implemented by a client and the other 3 by the network of which the client is a part of.

The layers are as follows:
1. `Application Layer` : This provides the end user an interface to all network related activites. 
2. `Presentation Layer` : Responsible for translating data and turning it into a format that can be consumed by a receiver.
3. `Session Layer` : Repsonsible for maintaing sessions between two peers over a network
4. `Transport Layer` : Responsible for message delivery between two peers over a network
5. `Network Layer` : Responsible for
6. `Datalink Layer` : Used for error free transfer of data frames
7. `Physical Layer` : Physical medium to transfer data
